# AutoMOC for Obsidian

This plugin automatically imports any linked mentions into the current note that are not already in the note at the current cursor location. <br><br>
When taking notes, one may forget to provide the backlink to the MOC for which a new note was linked. Over time this leads to many purely directional links. MOCs may miss many notes they are linked to simply by the user forgetting. <br><br>
This resolves that issue by checking for missing linked mentions and adding them to the current note at the current cursor location.
<br>

## Usage

After enabling this plugin, place your cursor in an editable markdown note where you want the links to be added. <br>
Run the plugin either through the command pallette, keyboard shortcut (must be mapped), or ribbon button.

There is an option to disable the ribbon button in the plugin settings. The plugin can still be activated by using the command pallete or by using a mapped hotkey.
